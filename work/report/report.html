<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>AO1: I’ve used github before but I’ve never created a tag on my upload since I’ve been leaving messages that tells exactly what I’ve done. 
    I’ve created small websites in other assignments from other courses but nothing like what we are creating now. 
    I only know what we’ve been taught in other courses. 
    For instance I know how to simply create a web application in Java and I know how to create it in C# as well which I taught myself over summer break since a company I want to work for only uses C#. 
    Today I didn’t learn much since we’ve used github on almost every course we’ve had and just needed to relearn git bash. 
    Other than that it was how to create tags for you github repo.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>AO2: I’ve got no previous experience in Javascript at all. 
    The browser loads a webpage depending on the URL. 
    This URL interacts with the web server to see if it is up and running. 
    If it is not you get a 500 error.
    The HTTP protocol in the header sends what connection you want to have it set up the connection with. 
    This time I learned the basics of Javascript and I can’t wait for the continuation of learning with Javascript/HTML.</p>
