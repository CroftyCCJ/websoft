<h2>S01</h2>
<p>AO1: I’ve used github before but I’ve never created a tag on my upload since I’ve been leaving messages that tells exactly what I’ve done. 
    I’ve created small websites in other assignments from other courses but nothing like what we are creating now. 
    I only know what we’ve been taught in other courses. 
    For instance I know how to simply create a web application in Java and I know how to create it in C# as well which I taught myself over summer break since a company I want to work for only uses C#. 
    Today I didn’t learn much since we’ve used github on almost every course we’ve had and just needed to relearn git bash. 
    Other than that it was how to create tags for you github repo. The github pages took a while to get used to and figure out how it works but I got there eventually.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>AO2: I’ve got no previous experience in Javascript at all. 
    The browser loads a webpage depending on the URL. 
    This URL interacts with the web server to see if it is up and running. 
    If it is not you get a 500 error.
    The HTTP protocol in the header sends what connection you want to have it set up the connection with. 
    This time I learned the basics of Javascript and I can’t wait for the continuation of learning with Javascript/HTML.

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>I've got no previous experience at all in JavaScript so this was completly new for me to do.
   JavaScript is similar to Java but yet very different in how it is built up. It might be closer to
   C# but that uses a completely difference base so it would be odd to compare the two in my opinion.
   I worked by doing one thing at a time and try to understand and change it to my liking. So it have its own twist to it
   I'm aiming for a 5 on it since I got all the requirments done for all of them with a twist. The code ended up not being
   I wanted since there isn't enough time to do it like I wanted it to be but it still turned out decent I would say.
   Today I learned how to code in JS CSS and HTML properly and it was very intruiging if I do say so myself.

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>I've got no previous experience of working with node/npm but I had heard of it before
   I feel like Express is getting outdated with new things coming out. Node is a bit different than
   previous tools that exists which is somewhat similar to each other. So I feel like even how node operates
   is outdated to todays standard and there should be better ways of running it than what we currently did with
   running it through the command tool.
   I did the same as in previous section where I read what is needed and went from there while thinking on how it should be done.
   Since I took less liberties due to the fact there wasn't as much you could take liberties with in this assignment it was pretty straight forward
   by just doing what was stated in the assignment.
   I found this way harder than the JS section since you always need to redo everything when you were running node on the pc.
   I am for a 5 since I feel like I have all the required coding exercises in there.
   I learned how NPM is seted up and how to use it.

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>I feel how php works there must be a better soloution to it than how we were using it.
   If you look online about it people keep on saying that php is not a coding language and should just die out.
   PHP is hard to compare because it is not really a programming langauge in my eyes since it doesn't really fill out the requirments to be called a coding language.
   I aim for a grade 4 on this one. Since I didn't really understood how it was supposed to be set up so I ended up only aiming for a 4.
   I'm satisfied with it to a degree but it could always be done better.
   Today I learned the basics of Php programming.

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>My opinion on popularity of the programming languages is that they are differently popular depending on what you are doing.
   For instance Java is not OS based but it needs to run on a JVM while C++ which is more popular inside the gaming industry are using that since then you can access the specific hardware.
   The differences when you are doing an analysis about coding languages is what you are going to use it for. For instance if you do an app for android then Java or kotlin would be most optimal.
   Due to this I don't see a point in trends since they are created to do different things.
   I would recomend for me personally probably C, C++ and C# since then you can access more without going into a VM like with Java and work close to the hardware.
   I didn't really learn much for this due to the fact that depending on what you are focusing on and what you are planning on creating it will look different for everyone.

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>The .NET platform is created through C# which microsoft made to create things direct for the windows OS.
   There is other ways to do it but Microsoft decided to buy up a part of it and make it for hobby users and easier to find a good tool to use
   for within the office packages. The .NET technologies are very similar to the node but much more updated and easier to use than the node setup in my opinion.
   It is easier to use rather than installing a bunch of packages through node as it seems to be an updated version of it.
   I took it on with going through the beginning to end. I'm not satisfied with it since I had HUGE issues with the web application and needed to recreate it several times until I finnaly got everything linked properly.
   So I only aimed for a 3 on this assignment in dismay due to all the issues I had creating the .NET. I don't know if something happend during project creation or somewhere else. Since I didn't have this much issues last time I
   used it I didn't know what went wrong but it finnaly worked after a few recreations and such.

<h2>S08</h2>
<p>
I've decided to analyse the webpages Facebook, HKR.se and google.
The reasoning for this is because it seems students are using these 3 sites quite a lot for projects to find the course material and so on.
On most pages the preformance was lacking on both facebook and HKR.
To save most of it on HKR was to preload the key requests serve images in next-gen formats, properly size the images and efficiently encode the images.
For facebook was mainly defer offscreen images and avoid multiple page redirects which they can't really do since they want as long of a wall as possible when you scroll through and there are so many page redirects onto the website
for every created page that it is almost impossible to remove those. For the accesibility on facebook which was quite low they recomended ARIA usage inside the application which seems quite intresting maybe they have thought of that
but couldn't get it work or there is another reason behind it.
The other catagories seems really close to each other in terms of loading pretty much and nothing out of the ordinary according to me.
Today I learned how to use the network tools and see different speeds of webpages.

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>Since I've not known or know anyone that have been affected by malware I'll just talk about how malware and scam emails and other security issues work in general.
For web browsers there is an old one called "You are an idiot" Which does what it says. It is a browser malware that shows up on the screen with smiley faces all around
stating you are an idiot. When you close or kill the process it will open more tabs of itself until it have killed your entire memory usage. Phising emails work like the old nigerian prince
letters where they are sent out to millions upon millions of email accounts saying "I want to send 2 million USD but to do that open an account on this bank and put in 2000 as a transfer fee"
or something similar. There is ransomware that was created in .NET called Jigsaw that deletes your files every hour or so until 72h have passed and then deletes all yoru files that is left or
the ransom is paid with 300 usd through bitcoins. This could be reverse engineered to show you the decryption key. You have WannaCry that is most known ransomware that is stated to come from
North Korea and it was a malware that used an exploit in windows XP and 7 called eternalblue. Jigsaw came from server sides that wasn't updated and WannaCry mainly tried to go to companies
instead of people that couldn't pay the ransom for the malware. The list could go on and on about malware and how they spread some even come from spam emails like the new one known as COVID-19
Also known as Corona which is currently in Italy. It is a trojan that is in a file from an email that looks like it comes from a medical proffesional to warn people and the trojan steals your
information and uses it for their own purposes. The main way to stop is to keep updating your keys and webprotocols to the newest stable build and try to fix the security holes/bugs that might
exist and make sure they are patched out. But mainly it is from the other end which is most dangerous they should always have a anti virus installed and always have it up to date. and update the 
browsers because that is also another way for them to infect the users PC. Chrome have security protocols created to stop malware or malicious code that could harm the computer from being downloaded
if you accidently does but there is always bugs in it.
